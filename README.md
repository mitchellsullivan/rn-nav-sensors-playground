# React Native Navigation and Sensors Personal Playground

2022-03-08

Doesn't build due to breaking changes in React Native. Just for credibility right now. TODO: Have working within the next few days as part of portfolio.

`fix-ios.sh` didn't work.

Demonstrates:
- Navigation combo:
  - Drawer
  - Stacks
  - Modal
- Sensors:
  - NFC read
  - BLE communication
  - Camera with AWS S3 upload
  - Accelerometer (x, y, z coords)
- Misc
  - In-app custom fonts (icons)
  - Custom splash screen and app icons
